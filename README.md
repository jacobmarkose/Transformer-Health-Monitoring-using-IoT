# Real-Time Transformer-Health-Monitoring-using-IoT

This contains a script I wrote along with my friend for our final year project. The project was about sending real time data to a central server for real time performance monitoring of Transformer. The sensors kept at different parts of the Transformer send real time data of load,oil level,temperature and gas level inside the Transformer to a Central server after manipulation from PIC Microcontroller which is connected to an IoT device. The PIC Micrcontroller keeps checking whether the incoming data is below or above the given threshold. if so, it will disconnect the supply using Relay attached to the system. Another separate webpage was created for viewing the data and to know the status of the Transformer working. The Program was developed using MPLAB IDE which is a proprietary freeware integrated development environment for the development of embedded applications on PIC and dsPIC microcontrollers and Proteus Design Suite used primarily for electronic design automation.
